# -Translation
## Something needs to know:
- I'm going to translate some well-written Portuguese articles or Front End sites into English.
"My English is not good enough, so there will be errors and room for improvement."
- Comments and suggestions for improvements in translations are most welcome.

## What I translated:
1. [Velocimetro SALVADOR](https://github.com/catiaabreu/-Translation/blob/master/Velocimetro%20SALVADOR.md)-Front End Performance Guide
